# Esport App Front End
 
Summary
 
Currenty working on a Web Application for Red Nation Esports.
I have some features working but planning to do a lot more in the future.

Created with React.

Goal

1. Logging in as a regular user to be able to sign up for events, get notified about annoucements, be able to sign up for teams and update there profile at anytime. 
2. Logging in as a admin user to be able to have CRUD functions for events, annoucements, teams, and users.
3. Security thinking about using JWT Tokens.

More Goals will be added when finishing up these ones.
